# Estimating f-Divergences (distances)

Implementation of the paper: *Practical and Consistent Estimation of f-Divergences.*

## Types of *f*-divergences / distances Researched

- Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence
- Squared Hellinger Distance
- Chi-Squared Divergence

## Experiments

- Currently only synthetic data experiments are available due to lack of access to the original data.

## Run

This notebook is originally developed inside in a tensorflow-gpu docker container, but should work with the CPU version.

You can also run the notebook in Google Colab:
